// The task:
// 1. Read and understand the Hierarchy data structure described in this file.
// 2. Implement filter() function.
// 3. Implement more test cases.
//
// The task should take 30-90 minutes.
//
// When assessing the submission, we will pay attention to:
// - correctness, efficiency, and clarity of the code;
// - the test cases.

/**
 * A `Hierarchy` stores an arbitrary _forest_ (an ordered collection of ordered trees)
 * as an array of node IDs in the order of DFS traversal, combined with a parallel array of node depths.
 *
 * Parent-child relationships are identified by the position in the array and the associated depth.
 * Each tree root has depth 0, its children have depth 1 and follow it in the array, their children have depth 2 and follow them, etc.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```
 * nodeIds: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
 * depths:  0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2
 * ```
 *
 * the forest can be visualized as follows:
 * ```
 * 1
 * - 2
 * - - 3
 * - - - 4
 * - 5
 * 6
 * - 7
 * 8
 * - 9
 * - 10
 * - - 11
 *```
 * 1 is a parent of 2 and 5, 2 is a parent of 3, etc. Note that depth is equal to the number of hyphens for each node.
 *
 * Invariants on the depths array:
 *  * Depth of the first element is 0.
 *  * If the depth of a node is `D`, the depth of the next node in the array can be:
 *      * `D + 1` if the next node is a child of this node;
 *      * `D` if the next node is a sibling of this node;
 *      * `d < D` - in this case the next node is not related to this node.
